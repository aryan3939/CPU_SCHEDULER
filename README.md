# CPU_SCHEDULER
CPU scheduling is the process of deciding which process gets to use the CPU while others wait. It ensures efficient utilization of system resources and fairness among processes
This project consists of a C++ simulator and a web-based user interface for evaluating various CPU scheduling algorithms. Users can input custom workload details through the web interface to analyze different performance metrics of the scheduling algorithms.
